algorithms
==========
Due to my poor understanding of various algorithms, I will attempt to implement some common sorting
algorithms.  Ideally, each sorting algorithm will be accompanied by documentation that explains
what's going on and the time complexity. Each algorithm should be templates so that I can directly apply them
to future projects.

The current plan:
  1. Selection sort
  2. Insertion sort
  3. Merge sort
  4. Heapsort
  5. Quicksort
  6. Bucket sort
  7. Radix sort
